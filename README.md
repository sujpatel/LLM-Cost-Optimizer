LLM Cost Optimizer

Creating an API that will help engineers optimize their costs when they build with different LLMs. AI API costs can be pricy, so using this API can help figure out if the LLM of your choice is the best decision before sending your request to the LLM.

Features:
- caching
- different LLM suggestions
- costs saved
- different common LLMs (Claude, GPT, eventually common open source models)
